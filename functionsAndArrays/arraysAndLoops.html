//Bonus Activity:
//Rewrite activity 6 to calculate the average of the amount of tasksCompleted that is equal to true
//Add your code below

//Create a function that takes two array parameters, the second parameter being a rest parameter
//Within your function block, specify a condition to prevent your function from having more than a 3 argument values
//Within the arguments condition, loop through the array arguments provided and concole.log each value
//Console.log your argument length an your function
//Refer to the Arguments method taught in the 3rd lesson
//Add your code below
